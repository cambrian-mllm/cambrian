There are a number of modeling techniques, including: Modeling can be performed by means of a dedicated program (e.g., 3D modeling software by Adobe Substance , Blender , Cinema 4D , LightWave , Maya , Modo , 3ds Max ) or an application component (Shaper, Lofter in 3ds Max) or some scene description language (as in POV-Ray ). In some cases, there is no strict distinction between these phases; in such cases modeling is just part of the scene creation process (this is the case, for example, with Caligari trueSpace and Realsoft 3D ). 3D models can also be created using the technique of Photogrammetry with dedicated programs such as RealityCapture , Metashape and 3DF Zephyr . Cleanup and further processing can be performed with applications such as MeshLab , the GigaMesh Software Framework , netfabb or MeshMixer. Photogrammetry creates models using algorithms to interpret the shape and texture of real-world objects and environments based on photographs taken from many angles of the subject. Complex materials such as blowing sand, clouds, and liquid sprays are modeled with particle systems , and are a mass of 3D coordinates which have either points , polygons , texture splats , or sprites assigned to them.",

[23] They are also used in the medical industry to create interactive representations of anatomy. [24] The medical industry uses detailed models of organs; these may be created with multiple 2-D image slices from an MRI or CT scan . The movie industry uses them as characters and objects for animated and real-life motion pictures . The video game industry uses them as assets for computer and video games . The science sector uses them as highly detailed models of chemical compounds. [25] The architecture industry uses them to demonstrate proposed buildings and landscapes in lieu of traditional, physical architectural models . Additionally, the use of Level of Detail (LOD) in 3D models is becoming increasingly important in the AEC industry. LOD is a measure of the level of detail and accuracy included in a 3D model. The LOD levels range from 100 to 500, with LOD 100 representing a conceptual model that shows the basic massing and location of objects, and LOD 500 representing an extremely detailed model that includes information about every aspect of the building, including MEP systems and interior finishes. By using LOD, architects , engineers , and General contractor can more effectively communicate design intent and make more informed decisions throughout the construction process. [26] [27] The archaeology community is now creating 3D models of cultural heritage for research and visualization. [28] [29] The engineering community utilizes them as designs of new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. In recent decades the earth science community has started to construct 3D geological models as a standard practice. 3D models can also be the basis for physical devices that are built with 3D printers or CNC machines . In terms of video game development, 3D modeling is one stage in a longer development process.  Simply put, the source of the geometry for the shape of an object can be: A wide number of 3D software are also used in constructing digital representation of mechanical models or parts before they are actually manufactured. CAD- and CAM -related software is used in such fields, and with this software, not only can you construct the parts, but also assemble them, and observe their functionality. 3D modeling is also used in the field of industrial design , wherein products are 3D modeled [30] before representing them to the clients. In media and event industries, 3D modeling is used in stage and set design . [31] The OWL 2 translation of the vocabulary of X3D can be used to provide semantic descriptions for 3D models , which is suitable for indexing and retrieval of 3D models by features such as geometry, dimensions, material, texture, diffuse reflection, transmission spectra, transparency, reflectivity, opalescence, glazes, varnishes, and enamels (as opposed to unstructured textual descriptions or 2.5D virtual museums and exhibitions using Google Street View on Google Arts & Culture , for example). [32] The RDF representation of 3D models can be used in reasoning , which enables intelligent 3D applications which, for example, can automatically compare two 3D models by volume. [33]",

Second, since these equations are difficult to solve, discretization and numerical methods are chosen to make an approximation to the governing equations. Then, algorithms in the computer can calculate the approximated solutions. Finally, interpretation can be made from those solutions. For instance, in mantle convection modeling, the flow of mantle can first be visualized. Then, the relationship between the patterns of flow and the input parameters may be concluded."

The Pecube model uses both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. [43] The fault can be regarded as stationary and the crust is moving. Initially, the temperature of the crust depends on the depth. The deeper the depth, the hotter the material. During this event, the motion of crust along the fault moves the material with different temperatures. In the hanging wall (the block above the fault), hotter material from deeper depth moves towards the surface; while the cooler material at shallower depth in the footwall (the block below the fault) moves deeper. The flow of material changes the thermal pattern (the isotherm bends across the fault) of the crust, which may reset the thermochronometers in the rock. On the other hand, the exhumation rate also affects the thermochronometers in the rock. A positive rate of exhumation indicates the rock is moving towards the surface, while a negative rate of exhumation indicate the rock is moving downwards.

[63] [64] In the model, the temperature of the core-mantle boundary (inner boundary) is a constant of 4273 K (about 4000°C), while that at the boundary between crust and mantle (outer boundary) is 973 K (about 700°C). [63] The mesh in the simulation changes over time. The code uses adaptive mesh refinement , the mesh is finer in the areas that need more accurate calculation, such as the rising plumes, while the mesh is coarser in other area to save the computational power. [63] In the figure, red color indicates a warmer temperature while blue color indicate a cooler temperature; hot material rises from the core mantle boundary due to lower density. When the hot material reaches the outer boundary, it starts to move in horizontally and eventually sinks due to cooling."

In most cases the term digital surface model represents the earth's surface and includes all objects on it. In contrast to a DSM, the digital terrain model (DTM) represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and buildings (see the figure on the right). [3] [4] DEM is often used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs, [5] only representing height information without any further definition about the surface. [6] Other definitions equalise the terms DEM and DTM, [7] equalise the terms DEM and DSM, [8] define the DEM as a subset of the DTM, which also represents other morphological elements, [9] or define a DEM as a rectangular grid and a DTM as a three-dimensional model ( TIN ). [10] Most of the data providers ( USGS , ERSDAC , CGIAR , Spot Image ) use the term DEM as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs. Some datasets such as SRTM or the ASTER GDEM are originally DSMs, although in forested areas, SRTM reaches into the tree canopy giving readings somewhere between a DSM and a DTM). DTMs are created from high resolution DSM datasets using complex algorithms to filter out buildings and other objects, a process known as \"bare-earth extraction\". [11] [12] In the following, the term DEM is used as a generic term for DSMs and DTMs.",

Visualizations are sometimes also done as oblique views, reconstructing a synthetic visual image of the terrain as it would appear looking down at an angle. In these oblique visualizations, elevations are sometimes scaled using \" vertical exaggeration \" in order to make subtle elevation differences more noticeable.
